read paths from file
(or accept external python input)
opital element path can be expressed as a queue
- should be able to traverse forwards and backwards
- should be able to insert and delete inner elements, or end elements
- matrix mutilplications carried out in sequence
 

for each element in queue:
        get info from path description (element, user specified data)
        case element:
               lens:  send focal
               distance:  send distance, index of refraction
               interface:  send n1, n2
               mirror:  send roc
        create new element matrix from sent data
        add element to processing queue

Calculate transfer matrix
for each element in processing queue:
